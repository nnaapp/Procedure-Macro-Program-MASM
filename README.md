# Procedure/Macro Program 3410
For assembly class CSC 3410, implements recursive factorial procedure, prime checking procedure, and evenness checking macro.


I strongly suggest just running this through Visual Studio, as assembling MASM is tedious at best. Another of my repositories,
an assignment for determining the endianness of your system, has instructions for assembling you can probably use if you REALLY want to.
But just use Visual Studio.
